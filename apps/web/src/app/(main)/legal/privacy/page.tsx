              We will only process your Personal Data if we have a lawful basis
              for doing so. Lawful bases for processing include consent,
              contractual necessity and our "legitimate interests" or the
              legitimate interest of others, as further described below:

                  We process some Personal Data as a matter of "contractual
                  necessity", meaning that we need to process the data to
                  perform under our Terms of Service with you, which enables us
                  to provide you with the Services. When we process data due to
                  contractual necessity, failure to provide such Personal Data
                  will result in your inability to use some or all portions of
                  the Services that require such data.

                  legitimate interests include (as described in more detail
